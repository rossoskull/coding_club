# Coders class

Coders are responsible for actually doing the (technical) events. They are expected to be technically sound and experienced. 
It should be noted that even people who are not part of Coder class can do events. They will have to send a proposal to do so.


## Roles/Responsibility

* Lead technical events
* Accept/Reject techical events, workshops and sessions proposals
* Provide support to aspiring coders whether online or one-to-one
* Be active on forum (coming soon!) and help students with doubts
